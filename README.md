# DFA-based Methods
* This is a repo for programming concepts from theortical CS
* The goal is to practice these concepts and learn Mojo language

## DFA_1
* {w | w starts with 0 }
* accepts only strings in {0, 1} that start with 0

## DFA_2  
* {w | w begins with 1 ends with 0 }
* q0 = start state
* q2 = accepting state
